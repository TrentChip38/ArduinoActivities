Turns an LED on and off at a given speed.
No circuit required, just plug in the Arduino and try to upload the sketch.

If the sketch doesn't upload:
    -Check your board type, we are using the Arduino Nano
    -Check that it is recognised on a com port, it should show up under boards
    -If its recognised but doesn't upload, try switching to the old bootloader under:
                "Tools" -> "Processor" -> "Atmega328P (Old Bootloader)"

If that doesn't work then you might not have the correct drivers. 
You will have to google to troubleshoot and find what kind of board driver you have.
Most likely type requires you to install the CH340 driver:
